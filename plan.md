# **5. Assessment & Mastery**

Item types:
- MCQs (MDD, bipolar, psychosis, GAD/panic, PTSD, ADHD, SUD, personality disorders)  
- Symptom classification tasks  
- Pattern recognition vignettes  
- Structured interview ordering  
- Differential narrowing questions  
- Synthetic scoring scenarios  

Provide **10–20 items with detailed rationales**.

---

# **6. Psychiatric Reasoning Framework**

Universal logic:
1. Determine **acuity** (suicidality, psychosis, withdrawal risk).  
2. Identify **symptom domain** (mood, anxiety, psychosis, trauma, attention, personality).  
3. Assess **duration** + functional impairment.  
4. Distinguish primary psychiatric vs substance-induced vs medical.  
5. Apply conceptual diagnostic rules (DSM-informed).  
6. Choose appropriate educational-level management category.  
7. Evaluate comorbidity + risk factors.  
8. Reassess safety and functional impact.

**Pitfalls to highlight:**
- Mislabeling bipolar depression as MDD  
- Missing psychosis in severe depression  
- Confusing panic with medical emergencies  
- Misclassifying PTSD vs GAD  
- Misattributing ADHD to anxiety or sleep deprivation  
- Confusing personality disorders with mood instability  
- Misreading withdrawal symptoms in SUD
